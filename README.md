# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug: Incorrect Use of $inc

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$inc` operator in MongoDB aggregation pipelines. The `$inc` operator is intended for update operations and should not be used to modify the results of an aggregation pipeline.  Attempting to use it this way will lead to unexpected behavior.

The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect implementation. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected approach.

## Bug Description
The issue lies in the inappropriate usage of the `$inc` operator within the aggregation pipeline.  This operator is designed to increment a field in a document, not to modify the results of an aggregation query.  In the incorrect example, the `$inc` stage attempts to increment the `count` field of the already aggregated results, which is not how the aggregation pipeline works.

## Solution
The correct way to achieve the desired result is to perform the increment within the `$group` stage itself using the `$sum` operator. This ensures that the increment happens while the data is being aggregated.
